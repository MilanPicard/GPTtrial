Trial_NCT02091531
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: MLN0128
Result: Negative
Explanation: MLN0128, a dual mTOR inhibitor, fits the guideline criteria as it targets a specific protein pathway related to prostate cancer treatment. However, the outcomes of the trial are unfavorable. The median time on treatment is only 11 weeks, and there's a significant median PSA rise of 159% from baseline, indicating a progression rather than control of the disease. Additionally, the best response shows that out of participants, only 1 had a count indicating a potential favorable response, likely a poor response rate. Hence, based on these outcomes, the treatment failed to demonstrate therapeutic benefits against prostate cancer.

Trial_NCT02093390
Fit guideline: No
Drug: TAK-385

Trial_NCT02247960
Fit guideline: No
Drug: Ciprofloxacin
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The clinical trial does not fit the guideline as it focuses on prevention of urinary tract infections with antibiotic prophylaxis and not on the therapeutic benefits of a drug-like pharmaceutical molecule against prostate cancer itself. Ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic, which is out of scope for the trials we are analyzing as per the specifically designed guideline which only includes drug-like molecules targeting prostate cancer specifically. Additionally, the intervention and condition in this trial (UTI prevention post-prostatectomy) do not align with the requirement to directly address prostate cancer therapeutic benefits. Therefore, it is not appropriate to assess the results of this trial in terms of therapeutic benefit against prostate cancer; thus, the result is indicated as "Neutral" because the guideline fit is negative and thus trial result is not relevant under the outlined conditions.

Drug: Abiraterone Acetate, Enzalutamide
Result: Positive
Explanation: The trial focuses exclusively on the effectiveness of drug-like pharmaceutical molecules (Abiraterone Acetate and Enzalutamide) in combination with LHRHa and Prednisone for prostate cancer treatment and meets the guideline requirements. The results show therapeutic benefits as indicated by higher proportions of participants achieving ypT2N0 stage in treatment group A compared to group B, suggesting that the addition of Enzalutamide may offer additional control over prostate cancer progression. Additionally, group A had higher proportions of participants with positive surgical margins, which indirectly implies greater tumor resectability or reduced invasiveness, hence a positive outcome.


Trial_NCT01946204
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Apalutamide
Result: Positive
Explanation: The trial focuses exclusively on prostate cancer and assesses the pharmaceutical drug apalutamide against a placebo. Apalutamide significantly extended Time to Metastasis, Progression-free Survival, Time to Symptomatic Progression, and Metastasis-Free Survival compared to placebo, with substantial differences in median months and statistically significant hazard ratios, supporting its therapeutic benefit. The absence of overall survival (OS) data for the apalutamide group in the outcomes does not invalidate these results given the positive outcomes in multiple other measures.

Trial_NCT01949337
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Enzalutamide, Abiraterone

However, the outcome results in the trial solely discuss the safety and tolerability, noting the number of participants with adverse events, without reporting on the therapeutic efficacy or survival data. Therefore, the result is classified as Neutral due to the lack of efficacy data provided.

Trial_NCT01995513
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Enzalutamide and Abiraterone
Result: Negative
Explanation: Despite the rigorous trials and combination therapy addressed, the results predominantly show either insignificant improvement over the control group (placebo + abiraterone + prednisone) or worse outcomes in several domains like quality of life scores, indicating no substantial therapeutic benefit of the added Enzalutamide therapy.

Trial_NCT01996852
Fit guideline: No
Drug: sildenafil citrate
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The clinical trial focuses primarily on treating erectile dysfunction following prostate cancer treatment, not directly assessing therapeutic benefits against prostate cancer itself. Thus, it does not fit the guideline as the primary condition of interest is not prostate cancer's therapeutic treatment. As the trial was also terminated early with outcomes not accessible, a neutral result is provided due to lack of data on efficacy or comparison of outcomes.

Trial_NCT01998685
Fit guideline: No
Drug: Propofol, remifentanyl, Midazolam, Fentanyl, Sevoflurane
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The clinical trial focuses on anesthetic techniques in prostate cancer surgery and does not assess drug-like pharmaceutical molecules specifically targeting prostate cancer mechanisms. Additionally, no therapeutic outcomes related to prostate cancer treatment efficacy are provided, leading to a neutral result classification.

Trial_NCT02001571
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Abiraterone acetate
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The clinical trial matches the guideline as it investigates a drug-like pharmaceutical molecule (Abiraterone acetate) in participants with prostate cancer. However, the result is classified as neutral because the trial was focused on pharmacokinetics and safety, and no specific therapeutic outcomes or efficacy results were reported.

Trial_NCT02003924
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Enzalutamide
Result: Positive
Explanation: The clinical trial evaluated the efficacy of Enzalutamide against placebo in patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, fitting the guideline criteria since it only involves a pharmaceutical intervention targeting a specific protein relevant to prostate cancer. Results show Enzalutamide significantly extended metastasis-free survival, time to PSA progression, and overall survival compared to placebo, indicating a therapeutic benefit.

Trial_NCT02012296
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Enzalutamide, Mifepristone
Result: Negative
Explanation: The trial fit the guideline since it assessed therapeutic benefits of drug-like molecules (Enzalutamide and Mifepristone) in prostate cancer. However, the results for the experimental group (Enzalutamide + Mifepristone) showed worse outcomes compared to the control group (Enzalutamide alone) in key areas such as PSA progression-free survival and number of participants with positive AR and GR expression. For instance, median PSA progression-free survival was 20.8 months for enzalutamide alone, but shorter at 16.5 months for the combination with mifepristone, and similar disparities are seen in other critical outcomes. This indicates that the addition of mifepristone reduced the efficacy of enzalutamide in treating metastatic hormone resistant prostate cancer.

Trial_NCT02012920
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Seviteronel
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The clinical trial targeted only prostate cancer and assessed the drug Seviteronel which fits the guideline of drug-like pharmaceutical molecules. However, no outcome data or results were provided in the summary, so the evaluation result is Neutral.

Trial_NCT02014337
Fit guideline: No
Drug: Mifepristone and Eribulin
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The trial includes prostate cancer among various other conditions like breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and lung cancer, thus it does not strictly focus on prostate cancer. Furthermore, the trial evaluates mifepristone and eribulin, which are not solely aimed at therapeutic interventions targeting proteins or pathways specific to prostate cancer treatment. As multiple conditions and non-targeted interventions are involved, it does not fit the guidelines. Additionally, the trial lacks comparative outcomes which makes the result neutral.

Trial_NCT02015871
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Degarelix
Result: Neutral
Explanation: Although the trial focused on prostate cancer and used a drug-like pharmaceutical molecule (Degarelix), it was primarily oriented towards assessing safety and tolerability over the long term without providing specific results on therapeutic efficacy, hence the result is classified as Neutral.

Trial_NCT02020135
Fit guideline: No
Drug: PSMA ADC
Result: Neutral
Explanation: PSMA ADC is classified as an antibody drug conjugate, which does not meet the specified guideline for drug-like pharmaceutical molecules. Instead, it falls under the category of monoclonal antibodies, which are excluded by the guideline. Thus, the clinical trial does not fit the specified guideline for assessment and analysis. Therefore, the result is classified as Neutral because the guideline criteria were not met, rather than assessing trial outcomes.

Trial_NCT02020291
Fit guideline: No
Drug: Foxy-5
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The trial does not fit the guideline because it assesses prostate cancer in combination with other cancers (breast and colorectal cancer). Thus, it cannot be solely focused on prostate cancer as per the guideline. Moreover, as no specific treatment outcomes or effectiveness results for prostate cancer were provided, the result is classified as Neutral.


Trial_NCT02023697
Fit guideline: No
Drug: Radium-223 dichloride
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The treatment assessed is Radium-223, a radio-ligand therapy, which does not fit the guideline for evaluating drug-like pharmaceutical molecules targeting specific metabolic or protein pathways in prostate cancer.

Trial_NCT02025010
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Abiraterone Acetate
Result: Negative
Explanation: The trial includes multiple outcomes assessing both safety and PSA response, where prednisone had to be added due to toxicities in several participants. The addition of prednisone to manage tolerance due to significant toxicities suggests that abiraterone acetate monotherapy does not demonstrate a clear therapeutic benefit without accompanying adverse effects in a substantial subset of patients. Moreover, the median duration of PSA response under AA monotherapy is relatively short (3 months), and while it improved slightly with the addition of prednisone (5 months), it suggests a limited efficacy of AA alone in managing castration-resistant prostate cancer effectively over a longer period. Given these safety and efficacy challenges and based on the predefined operational guidelines, the result seems more aligned to negative rather than showing a clear therapeutic benefit.

Trial_NCT02034552
Fit guideline: No
Drug: Radium-223 Dichloride
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The clinical trial investigates Radium-223 Dichloride, which is a radio-ligand, not fitting the guideline of assessing only drug-like pharmaceutical molecules. Consequently, the guideline fit is "No" and any further assessment of results is moot, leading to a neutral result classification by default.

Trial_NCT02077634
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: abiraterone acetate
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The trial fits the guideline as it assesses a drug-like pharmaceutical molecule (abiraterone acetate) specifically targeting prostate cancer. However, no outcomes or results were provided in the trial summary, thus the result is classified as Neutral.

Trial_NCT02085252
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Leuprorelin
Result: Positive
Explanation: Even though one outcome shows results unfavorable for Leuprorelin (Result 8 with IIEF-5 scores), significant benefits, including better control in biopsy outcomes, a lower Gleason score, better PSA levels reduction, and smaller lesion sizes, have been reported across multiple primary outcomes. These substantial therapeutic benefits regarding the progression and management of indolent prostate cancer outweigh the single negative outcome and justify a "Positive" classification.

Trial_NCT01511536
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Cabazitaxel, Abiraterone Acetate
Result: Positive
Explanation: The trial focused solely on prostate cancer and assessed therapeutic benefits of pharmaceutical molecules Cabazitaxel and Abiraterone Acetate. Results indicated a PSA response rate of 46.2% and observable objective responses (CR and PR), which supports the positive therapeutic impact of the treatment. Some outcomes like Median PFS, Median OS were not provided, but available data supports a beneficial response, overriding the neutral outcomes.

Trial_NCT01511874
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: ELIGARD
Result: Neutral
Explanation: This clinical trial only discusses the efficacy and safety of ELIGARD for prostate cancer treatment, fitting the guideline. However, since no specific outcomes or results were provided, the result must be classified as Neutral.

Trial_NCT01513733
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: tasquinimod
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The clinical trial fits the guideline as it is only focused on prostate cancer and assesses the efficacy of a drug-like pharmaceutical molecule, despite tasquinimod being combined with cabazitaxel (which itself generally fits the guideline of pharmacological interventions). The result of the trial is classified as neutral because no outcomes or results regarding the efficacy of the treatment regimen were provided.

Trial_NCT01517802
Fit guideline: No
Drug: Abiraterone acetate
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The trial does not fit the guidelines as it assesses conditions other than prostate cancer, specifically including metastatic breast cancer. Additionally, the study primarily focuses on the long-term safety follow-up of abiraterone acetate rather than its therapeutic efficacy against prostate cancer. The result is listed as neutral because the trial primarily assessed safety and no efficacy outcomes are mentioned.

Trial_NCT01518283
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Cabazitaxel
Result: Neutral
Explanation: This clinical trial fits the guideline as it evaluates a drug-like pharmaceutical molecule (Cabazitaxel) specifically for prostate cancer. However, the result is classified as Neutral because the summary specifies that no outcomes or results were given, hence further analysis cannot be done based on therapeutic benefits or efficacy.

Trial_NCT01519414
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Tivantinib
Result: Positive
Explanation: The trial fits the guidelines as it focuses solely on prostate cancer and tests the pharmaceutical molecule Tivantinib. Tivantinib showed a significant increase in progression-free survival compared to the placebo (5.5 months vs. 3.7 months, p-value: 0.02) indicating therapeutic benefits. Other outcomes also favored Tivantinib, like the PSA response rate and radiographic response rate, where Tivantinib's group had a better outcome than the control group.

Trial_NCT01521949
Fit guideline: No
Drug: Acai Juice Product
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The trial assessed the use of Acai Juice, which is a natural product, not a drug-like pharmaceutical molecule fitting the specified criteria for this analysis. As such, the trial does not fit the guideline, and the result classification becomes irrelevant in this context.

Trial_NCT01522443
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: cabozantinib
Result: Positive
Explanation: The trial specifically investigated cabozantinib against prostate cancer (castration-resistant prostate cancer) and its effects in comparison to mitoxantrone plus prednisone. The results showed a significant difference favoring cabozantinib in Bone Scan Response (BSR) with a P-value of 0.001. Although there were similar results in Pain Response and the overall survival improvement was not statistically significant (P-value: 0.121), the significant improvement in BSR prioritizes over the other outcomes following the predefined instructions, which leads to a classification of 'Positive'.

Trial_NCT01522820
Fit guideline: No
Drug: Sirolimus, DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 Fusion Protein CDX-1401
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The clinical trial involves a vaccine therapy and multiple cancer types, including prostate cancer, which does not fit the specified guideline that restricts the focus to trials only assessing drug-like pharmaceutical molecules specifically against prostate cancer. Additionally, the trial includes a vaccine therapy and Sirolimus, which is used to modify the immune response, not directly targeting prostate cancer mechanisms. No outcomes or results provided, thus the result is neutral.

Trial_NCT01530269
Fit guideline: No
Drug: C11-Sodium Acetate
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The trial involves C11-Sodium Acetate, an imaging agent used in PET/CT scans, which does not meet the guideline requirements for pharmaceutical interventions targeting proteins, pathways or mechanisms relevant to prostate cancer treatment. Additionally, the trial assessed imaging capabilities rather than therapeutic benefits of drug-like molecules.

Trial_NCT01531205
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Cabazitaxel
Result: Negative
Explanation: The clinical trial had negative results for key outcomes. It reported a 0% PSA Progression Free Survival, a 0% incidence of Complete Response, and zero participants showing negative surgical margins post-surgery, which generally indicates a failure to achieve the desired therapeutic effects of treatment in reducing or eliminating cancer presence and progression.

Trial_NCT01533246
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Linsitinib
Result: Negative
Explanation: The trial results show poor therapeutic outcomes such as a median Time to PSA Progression of only 1.8 months, median Overall Survival of 3.7 months, and median Progression Free Survival of 4.7 months. Only one patient showed a PSA response and measurable disease response, suggesting low efficacy of linsitinib in treating metastatic prostate cancer.

Trial_NCT01533753
Fit guideline: No
Drug: Gabapentin, Venlafaxine
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The clinical trial assesses the effect of Gabapentin and Venlafaxine on hot flashes in patients with prostate cancer, which is a symptom management issue rather than directly addressing the therapeutic treatment of prostate cancer itself. The trial's focus on quality of life related to symptom control (hot flashes) does not fit the guideline criteria, which specifies drugs evaluated for direct therapeutic benefits against prostate cancer.

Trial_NCT01535040
Fit guideline: No
Drug: memantine hydrochloride
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The clinical trial focuses on smoking cessation among cancer survivors including prostate cancer, but it also includes other types of cancer (breast, colorectal, lung), which does not fit the specific guideline of only assessing therapeutic benefits against prostate cancer. Additionally, the primary intervention, memantine hydrochloride, is being assessed for its efficacy in helping with nicotine withdrawal, not directly targeting prostate cancer or its mechanisms.

Trial_NCT01541007
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Cabazitaxel
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The clinical trial exclusively targeted metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and assessed the therapeutic benefits of the drug-like pharmaceutical molecule cabazitaxel under different scheduling. No outcomes or results were provided regarding the efficacy of the treatment schedules, thereby making conclusive efficacy classification impossible. Hence, the result is classified as Neutral.

Trial_NCT01543659
Fit guideline: No
Drug: 89Zr-DFO-huJ591
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The clinical trial involves the assessment of a radioligand (89Zr-DFO-huJ591), which is used in PET scans for imaging rather than as a therapeutic drug-like molecule. Additionally, the trial focuses on imaging efficacy and distribution, rather than therapeutic benefits against prostate cancer. As such, it does not fit the guideline of assessing drug-like pharmaceutical molecules for therapeutic benefits in prostate cancer.

Trial_NCT01543776
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Abiraterone Acetate
Result: Positive
Explanation: The trial accurately assesses a pharmaceutical molecule, Abiraterone Acetate, in treating prostate cancer, fitting the guideline. Outcome 1 demonstrated that Arm II (Fed) had a more significant reduction in PSA levels compared to Arm I (Fasting), indicative of a therapeutic benefit. Despite similar results in progression-free survival (Outcome 2) and mixed findings in other outcomes, the improvement in the primary therapeutic marker (PSA) under experimental feeding conditions supports a positive result.

Trial_NCT01546623
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: TAP-144-SR(6M)
Result: Positive
Explanation: The data provided shows various outcomes where TAP-144-SR(6M) predominantly maintains or exceeds performance compared to TAP-144-SR(3M). In several key evaluations (like PSA suppression and soft tissue response), TAP-144-SR(6M) demonstrated beneficial effects. Thus, the trial exhibits positive therapeutic benefits for prostate cancer with this drug.

Trial_NCT01546987
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: TAK-700
Result: Negative
Explanation: In the trial comparing ADT + RT and TAK-700 + ADT + RT, the outcomes showed that the treatment with TAK-700 did not consistently result in better outcomes compared to the control (ADT + RT). Particularly with the primary endpoint of overall survival, where the TAK-700 group showed lower survival rates (88.1%) compared to the control group (89.4%). Additionally, the percentage of participants with grade 3 or higher adverse events was significantly higher in the TAK-700 group (58.9% vs. 34.9%), indicating higher toxicity. Despite some better outcomes in lower biochemical failure and distant metastases rates, the serious adverse events and lack of overall survival benefit define the result as Negative.

Trial_NCT01547299
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Enzalutamide
Result: Negative
Explanation: Although the trial focused on prostate cancer and used a drug-like molecule (Enzalutamide), the results show no significant benefit. Enzalutamide alone did not improve pathologic complete response (0.0% in all reports), had higher percentages of participants with positive surgical margins and extracapsular extension compared to the combination therapy, and overall did not demonstrate a superior outcome across various clinical parameters. Thus, it failed to demonstrate therapeutic benefit.

Trial_NCT01547416
Fit guideline: No
Drug: Epidural 250mL of 0.2% ropivacaine and 2 Î¼g/mL of fentanyl
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The trial does not fit the guideline because it focuses on evaluating the effects of anesthesia methods rather than assessing pharmaceutical molecules targeting prostate cancer specifically. Additionally, no outcomes regarding prostate cancer treatment effectiveness were provided.

Trial_NCT01549951
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Orteronel
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The trial only assesses safety parameters related to cardiovascular effects (QT interval changes and other ECG changes) in the context of prostate cancer treatment, without comparative efficacy data or direct prostate cancer therapeutic outcomes. Therefore, there's no conclusive evidence of therapeutic benefit against prostate cancer as per the outcomes given.

Trial_NCT01553188
Fit guideline: No
Drug: Trebananib (AMG 386)
Result: Neutral

Trial_NCT01574937
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Cabozantinib, Abiraterone
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The trial only assessed the safety and appropriate dose levels for Cabozantinib in combination with Abiraterone, and it did not provide any results on efficacy outcomes (like survival or disease progression). Therefore, the result is classified as Neutral.

Trial_NCT01576029
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Cabazitaxel, Docetaxel
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The clinical trial assesses the effects of docetaxel and cabazitaxel on patients with Castration-Resistant Metastatic Prostate Cancer, fitting the guideline for assessing therapeutic benefits strictly against prostate cancer using drug-like pharmaceutical molecules. However, the results or outcomes of the trial are not provided, leading to a neutral classification as conclusions cannot be drawn about the efficacy or comparative benefits of the treatments.

Trial_NCT01576172
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Abiraterone Acetate, Prednisone, Veliparib
Result: Positive
Explanation: The clinical trial exclusively assesses the therapeutic benefits of Abiraterone Acetate, Prednisone, and Veliparib in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, which meets the guideline criteria. The addition of Veliparib in Arm II resulted in consistently better or equivalent outcomes across several measures compared to Arm I which used Abiraterone Acetate and Prednisone alone. This includes a higher Confirmed PSA Response Rate, a more substantial decline in PSA at 12 weeks, better Objective Response Rates, and prolonged Progression-free Survival, despite slightly higher severe adverse events in Arm II. The results predominantly show therapeutic benefits with the drugs being assessed.

Trial_NCT01578655
Fit guideline: No
Drug: Custirsen
Result: Neutral
Explanation: Custirsen is an oligonucleotide, which is specifically excluded from the trials of interest based on the provided guidelines. As a result, this trial does not fit the guideline. Additionally, no specific outcomes or results were provided from the study; hence, the result for this analysis is neutral.

Fit guideline: No
Drug: Saw Palmetto
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The clinical trial primarily focuses on symptom management during radiation therapy, specifically assessing the role of Saw Palmetto in improving health-related quality of life and managing urinary symptoms among prostate cancer patients. The main objective does not align with assessing direct therapeutic benefits against prostate cancer itself, such as tumor shrinkage or increased survival rates. Hence, this study does not fit the guideline which exclusively targets trials investigating the direct therapeutic impacts of drug-like pharmaceuticals on prostate cancer. Additionally, Saw Palmetto is not considered a drug-like pharmaceutical molecule focused on specific proteins or pathways crucial for prostate cancer treatment. As the trial does not meet the guideline, the result is noted as Neutral without delving into specific outcome comparisons.

Trial_NCT01591122
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Abiraterone acetate
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The trial is focused on prostate cancer and assesses a drug-like pharmaceutical molecule; however, no outcomes or results were provided to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.

Trial_NCT01594918
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Cabazitaxel, Mitoxantrone
Result: Neutral

Thus, the result is classified as Neutral due to the lack of available efficacy data.

Trial_NCT01595087
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Osteodex
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The trial exclusively focuses on prostate cancer as required, and Osteodex, a drug-like pharmaceutical molecule, matches our guideline. There were no comparative outcomes or results reported in the clinical trial summary provided; therefore, the result is classified as Neutral due to the inability to assess therapeutic effectiveness based on available information.

Trial_NCT01599793
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: cabozantinib
Result: Negative
Explanation: Although the clinical trial fits the guideline with cabozantinib being a drug-like pharmaceutical molecule assessed for prostate cancer, the result is categorized as Negative. This conclusion is because the data from Progression Free Survival (PFS) are described as inconclusive with "too few events for a meaningful statistical analysis," the correlation and changes reported are not significant in positively impacting the progression or management of prostate cancer or related parameters. Other outcomes either had no significant improvement or the required data were not collected. Hence, the drug did not demonstrate a therapeutic benefit.

Trial_NCT01603420
Fit guideline: No
Drug: Conformal Radiation Therapy (RT), Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH), Docetaxel
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The trial was not within guidelines as it included radiotherapy (Conformal Radiation Therapy) which is not a drug-like pharmaceutical molecule. Thus, further analysis of results is moot since the trial is already excluded based on the intervention type.

Trial_NCT01605227
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: cabozantinib
Result: Positive
Explanation: The trial exclusively focuses on prostate cancer, assessing the therapeutic benefits of the drug-like molecule cabozantinib against metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Cabozantinib demonstrated therapeutic benefits in comparisons with prednisone, evidenced by both improved overall survival and progression-free survival metrics. The median overall survival for patients treated with cabozantinib was 11.0 months compared to 9.8 months for those on prednisone. Additionally, the hazard ratio for progression-free survival significantly favored cabozantinib with a value of 0.48 and a p-value of 0.001, indicating a significantly delayed progression of disease relative to prednisone. The bone scan response also favored cabozantinib with significantly more patients achieving a reduction in bone scan lesion area.

Trial_NCT01607879
Fit guideline: No
Drug: HMB + arginine + glutamine
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The intervention being assessed is a nutritional supplement (HMB + arginine + glutamine), not a drug-like pharmaceutical molecule targeting specific proteins, metabolic pathways, or other mechanisms relevant specifically to prostate cancer treatment. Thus, it does not fit the guideline. Additionally, since the trial does not compare therapeutic effectiveness against prostate cancer specifically, but instead targets muscle loss due to ADT, the result is classified as Neutral.

Trial_NCT01615120
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: GTx-758
Result: Positive
Explanation: The trial specifically evaluated GTx-758 in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, which aligns with guideline as it focuses solely on prostate cancer and assesses a drug-like pharmaceutical molecule. The results demonstrate therapeutic benefits as shown by a decline in serum PSA levels, with a greater number of participants in the 250 mg group experiencing a 50% decline in PSA compared to the 125 mg group. Thus, the drug shows effectiveness in reducing PSA levels, a key marker in prostate cancer progression.

Trial_NCT01615406

Trial_NCT01620515
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: NX-1207
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The trial assesses the therapeutic benefits of NX-1207 for prostate cancer, but no specific results or outcomes were provided, making it impossible to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment. Thus, the result is classified as Neutral.

Trial_NCT01620593
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Metformin
Result: Negative
Explanation: Although Metformin shows some effects on reducing insulin resistance associated with castration therapy, it doesn't show a clear therapeutic benefit regarding the primary treatment of prostate cancer. Specifically, the treatment fails to show better outcomes for waist circumference. Although there is a significant improvement in PSA response with metformin (8.36 ng/ml) compared to placebo (58.2 ng/ml), the associated increase in adverse events (7 participants with adverse events in the metformin group versus none in the placebo group) and no clear improvement in other crucial outcomes (such as treatment failure or weight change both of which show no improvement with metformin) highlight its limited therapeutic efficacy against prostate cancer in this setting. This leads to a negative conclusion despite one positive outcome.

Trial_NCT01630590
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Cabozantinib
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The clinical trial involves Cabozantinib, a drug-like pharmaceutical molecule, used in combination with androgen ablation therapy for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer which fits the guideline. It's a single-arm study focused on the therapeutic benefit of adding Cabozantinib to hormonal therapy. Given there are no comparative arms, and the outcomes focus on safety, progression-free survival without a comparison group, the result is neutral due to the inability to make a direct effectiveness comparison.

Trial_NCT01631552
Fit guideline: No
Drug: Sacituzumab Govitecan-hziy
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The drug tested is Sacituzumab Govitecan-hziy, which is a monoclonal antibody drug conjugate and does not fit the specified guidelines for drug-like pharmaceutical molecules.

Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Enzalutamide, Abiraterone Acetate
Result: Negative
Explanation: The trial was focused on assessing the therapy benefits of Enzalutamide and Abiraterone Acetate for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, thus fitting the guideline. However, despite the evaluation of various laboratory parameters indicating biological activity (changes in hormone levels), there were no clear therapeutic benefits observed in the primary clinical outcomes such as survival or significant tumor response compared to baseline standards. Moreover, the adverse event profile and lack of improvement in critical endpoints like PSA levels suggest that the treatment combination did not offer a substantial clinical benefit.

Trial_NCT01650285
Fit guideline: No
Drug: Cabazitaxel and Radiation
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The inclusion of radiation in the treatment protocol does not fit the guideline as we only assess the benefits of drug-like pharmaceutical molecules without the adjunct of radiotherapies. Therefore, despite Cabazitaxel fitting the criterion as a pharmacological agent, the combined therapy with radiation disqualifies the trial from the guideline.

Trial_NCT01650350
Fit guideline: No
Drug: Naltrexone

Trial_NCT01308567
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Cabazitaxel, Docetaxel
Result: Negative
Explanation: While both cabazitaxel and docetaxel are drug-like pharmaceutical molecules evaluated for therapeutic benefits in prostate cancer, the trial results indicate no significant superiority in overall survival and progression-free survival for cabazitaxel compared to docetaxel. The hazard ratios for overall survival (OS) for the highest dose of cabazitaxel are close to 1 (HR: 0.975 and HR: 1.009), with non-significant p-values, suggesting no substantial benefit over docetaxel. Additionally, in other assessed outcomes like pain progression-free survival and skeletal-related events free survival, either cabazitaxel performed similar or worse in comparison to docetaxel. Thus, the treatment did not demonstrate superior efficacy needed for positive classification.

Trial_NCT01308580
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Cabazitaxel
Result: Negative
Explanation: While assessing overall survival, cabazitaxel at 20 mg/m^2 showed a median survival of 13.4 months compared to cabazitaxel at 25 mg/m^2 with a median survival of 14.5 months. Similarly, across multiple outcome metrics such as Progression Free Survival, Time to Tumor Progression, Percentage of Participants With Overall Objective Tumor Response, Time to PSA Progression, and other measures, consistently the 25 mg/m^2 dosage resulted in better outcomes than the 20 mg/m^2. Thus, there's a clear indication that higher dosage provides better efficacy, making the result negative for effectiveness of the 20 mg/m^2 as a beneficial therapeutic option over the 25 mg/m^2 dosage.

Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: GTx-758
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The trial fits the guideline as it assesses the therapeutic benefits of a drug-like molecule, GTx-758, specifically targeting prostate cancer. However, the trial was terminated early due to an FDA Clinical Hold, and the results section provided is inconclusive as it only lists counts of participants without clear context or comparison to baseline or a control group, making it impossible to determine efficacy from the information given. Thus, the result is classified as Neutral.

Trial_NCT01420965
Fit guideline: No
Drug: Sipuleucel-T, CT-011, Cyclophosphamide
Result: Neutral
Explanation: Sipuleucel-T is classified as a vaccine, and CT-011 is an anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody, both of which do not meet the study guidelines defined for assessing only drug-like pharmaceutical molecules. Cyclophosphamide, although a chemotherapy agent, is not the primary drug of interest as per guideline specifics to assess drugs targeting specific proteins or metabolic pathways in prostate cancer treatment. The inclusion of a vaccine and a monoclonal antibody makes this trial unfit per the stated guidelines, regardless of the study outcomes.

Trial_NCT01424930
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Abiraterone
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The clinical trial primarily focused on assessing the pharmacokinetic properties (Cmax, Tmax, AUC24h) and safety of Abiraterone with Prednisone in different meal conditions rather than therapeutic efficacy against prostate cancer. Since no therapeutic outcomes were measured (such as survival, progression, or response rates), the results are considered Neutral.


Trial_NCT01428219
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Cabozantinib
Result: Negative
Explanation: Although the trial fits the guideline as it assesses cabozantinib, a drug-like pharmaceutical molecule, in prostate cancer, the results indicate that it was terminated due to negative results of a phase III trial of the same drug and also suggests low efficacy with slowing enrollment. Moreover, some outcomes like low percentage of progression-free survival by PSA and short median time to PSA progression further support a lack of substantial therapeutic benefit.

Trial_NCT01429064
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: ODM-201
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The trial is focused on prostate cancer and assesses a drug-like pharmaceutical molecule (ODM-201), meeting the fit guideline criteria. However, the sole purpose of the trial is to evaluate safety and tolerability, not therapeutic efficacy in terms of survival, progression, or response rates.

Trial_NCT01433913
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Metformin Hydrochloride
Result: Negative
Explanation: Despite metformin hydrochloride being a drug-like pharmaceutical molecule targeting metabolic pathways, the outcomes of this clinical trial do not demonstrate a therapeutic benefit over placebo in most key measures, including cell proliferation (p=0.23), apoptosis levels (p=0.77), mTOR regulation (p=0.72), and changes in serum PSA levels (p=0.63), where either there was no significant difference or placebo performed better. These results indicate that metformin hydrochloride did not significantly benefit prostate cancer treatment compared to placebo.

Trial_NCT01434342
Fit guideline: No
Drug: Nicotine Replacement Patch
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The clinical trial is focused on smoking cessation among cancer patients, including those with prostate cancer but also involving other types of cancer (lung, breast, colorectal, etc.). The intervention assessed is nicotine replacement therapy, which is not a drug-like pharmaceutical molecule targeting specific proteins, metabolic pathways, or mechanisms relevant specifically to prostate cancer treatment. Therefore, the trial does not fit the specified guidelines for assessing therapeutic benefits against prostate cancer. Furthermore, the outcomes reported are related to the feasibility and adherence to a smoking cessation intervention, which does not directly assess therapeutic efficacy against prostate cancer itself. Hence, the result classification here is Neutral due to the trialâs focus and the nature of the intervention.

Trial_NCT01443026
Fit guideline: No
Drug: Lycopene
Result: Neutral
Explanation: Lycopene is not considered a drug-like pharmaceutical molecule but rather a dietary supplement.

Trial_NCT01487720
Fit guideline: No
Drug: Oxaliplatin
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The trial includes the use of Oxaliplatin, which is a platinum-based agent. As per the guidelines, trials assessing platinum-based agents do not fit the guidelines for evaluation of drug-like pharmaceutical molecules strictly for prostate cancer therapeutics. Due to this, and as the trial cannot be used to assess the efficacy of the drug for the intended guidance, the fitting to guideline is "No", and result is indicated as "Neutral", given that the outcome importance is moot.

Trial_NCT01487863
Fit guideline: No
Drug: Sipuleucel-T
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The clinical trial involves Sipuleucel-T, which is an autologous cell product (a type of cellular therapy), not a drug-like pharmaceutical molecule. Therefore, it does not meet the guideline criteria for evaluating only drug-like pharmaceutical molecules targeting specific proteins, metabolic pathways, or other mechanisms relevant to prostate cancer treatment. Consequently, the result classification and specific explanation regarding trial outcomes are not applicable.

Trial_NCT01491971

Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Cinacalcet Hydrochloride
Result: Negative
Explanation: The trial specifically assesses the therapeutic benefit of Cinacalcet Hydrochloride, a drug-like pharmaceutical molecule, on prostate cancer, fitting the guideline criteria perfectly. However, in terms of outcomes, there isn't clear evidence that Cinacalcet Hydrochloride provides a therapeutic benefit in lowering PSA levels conclusively, as the change in PSA levels is minimal (median parameter value of 0.0825). Furthermore, although quality of life and hormonal assessment scales are measured, the results do not indicate significant improvement, and in some aspects (higher scores indicating worse outcomes), the scores even increase. Therefore, without demonstrating a clear benefit in the primary outcome or significantly improving related quality of life scores, the overall result is negative.

Trial_NCT01057810
Fit guideline: No
Drug: Ipilimumab
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The trial does not fit the guideline because it assesses a monoclonal antibody (Ipilimumab), which falls outside the scope of drug-like pharmaceutical molecules specified in your criteria.

Trial_NCT01084759
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Testosterone and Etoposide
Result: Positive
Explanation: The trial focuses solely on prostate cancer treatment using drug-like pharmaceutical molecules, testosterone and etoposide, fitting the guideline. The outcomes show therapeutic benefits as 42.9% of patients had a PSA below baseline after 3 months, the median time to PSA progression was 221 days, and 7 participants showed complete or partial tumor response according to RECIST criteria. These results indicate an overall positive effect of the treatment on prostate cancer progression and response.

Trial_NCT01085422
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: ABT-888, temozolomide
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The trial is focused on assessing the therapeutic benefits of ABT-888 combined with temozolomide specifically in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Trial_NCT01086956
Fit guideline: No
Drug: ropivacaine and sufentanil
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The clinical trial is evaluating the effects of ropivacaine and sufentanil in an anesthetic context, rather than assessing therapeutic benefits against prostate cancer directly. Additionally, as these drugs are used in an anesthetic context rather than for prostate cancer treatment itself, it does not meet the guideline's criteria for drug-like pharmaceutical molecules targeting the cancer. Furthermore, since no outcomes or results were provided, the result is classified as Neutral.

Trial_NCT01088529
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Abiraterone Acetate
Result: Positive
Explanation: The trial fits the guideline since it is focused solely on prostate cancer and evaluates the therapeutic benefits of a drug-like pharmaceutical molecule, Abiraterone Acetate, a direct inhibitor of androgen production. The results indicate that the Abiraterone Acetate group showed significantly better outcomes in terms of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response compared to the LHRHa alone group, with a high relative risk and a statistically significant p-value. Although the other outcomes assessed (pathologic tumor stage and positive surgical margins) did not show statistical significance, the pronounced improvement in PSA response is a critical therapeutic benefit in prostate cancer treatment, therefore, the result is Positive.

Trial_NCT01090765
Fit guideline: No
Drug: TRC105
Result: Neutral
Explanation: TRC105 is a monoclonal antibody, which does not fit the guidelines for inclusion as we are only interested in drug-like pharmaceutical molecules that are not monoclonal antibodies. Therefore, regardless of the trial outcomes, the trial does not fit the guideline for analysis.

Trial_NCT01093183
Fit guideline: Yes  
Drug: Lenalidomide, Cyclophosphamide  
Result: Positive  
Explanation: The trial involved only prostate cancer and used drug-like molecules, meeting the guideline requirements. The trial reported improvements in anti-tumor activity, with a number of patients showing a PSA response, and some achieving stable disease under treatment with lenalidomide and cyclophosphamide. Despite no CRs achieved, these results suggest therapeutic benefits overall.

Trial_NCT01094288
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Alisertib
Result: Negative
Explanation: The trial evaluated the effect of Alisertib plus Docetaxel, but the outcomes focus exclusively on adverse events, pharmacokinetics, and overall response rates without showing a clear benefit on survival or disease control specific to prostate cancer criteria like progression or substantial PSA reduction relative to a control. The therapeutic efficacy cannot be established conclusively for prostate cancer treatment as no specific positive outcome on survival or long-term disease management was highlighted.

Trial_NCT01105130
Fit guideline: No
Drug: L-Arginine
Result: Neutral
Explanation: This trial does not fit the guidelines as it primarily addresses erectile function in prostate cancer survivors rather than therapeutic benefits against prostate cancer itself. Additionally, L-Arginine is not classified as a drug-like pharmaceutical molecule targeting specific proteins or metabolic pathways relevant exclusively to cancer treatment. Thus, guidelines are not met, and the result is classified as Neutral due to the trial's focus being outside the intended assessment scope.

Trial_NCT01106352
Fit guideline: No
Drug: Radium-223 dichloride
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The clinical trial does not fit the guideline as it involves Radium-223 dichloride, a radio-ligand, which is outside the scope of interest for drug-like pharmaceutical molecules targeting specific proteins or pathways.

Trial_NCT01118741
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Disulfiram
Result: Negative
Explanation: Although the trial targets prostate cancer specifically and disulfiram is a pharmaceutical molecule, the results show a negative outcome. As per the trial's data, while there was some demethylation response, the clinical response measured by PSA progression at 6 months in patients was not favorable, particularly for the low dose (250mg) where 5 participants showed PSA progression, indicating a failure to demonstrate therapeutic benefit in terms of preventing PSA progression within the context of biochemical relapse after local therapy. The higher dose (500mg) had no participants with PSA progression, but this does not outweigh the negative outcome in the low dose group. Additionally, without comparative control data, this result is leaned towards 'Negative' considering the increase in PSA in the 250mg treated group, suggesting lack of efficacy to halt disease progression.

Trial_NCT01119118
Fit guideline: Yes

Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Lenalidomide
Result: Negative
Explanation: Although lenalidomide exhibited some promise in blocking blood flow to the tumor and was evaluated in combination with GM-CSF to enhance the immune response against prostate cancer, the trial outcomes did not overwhelmingly demonstrate therapeutic benefits. The primary endpoint, the number of patients showing a PSA decline of 50% or more, was relatively low. Additionally, no significant change in immune response metrics (T cell markers and dendritic cells) was recorded, and the RECIST-defined measurable disease outcomes were not robust enough to suggest a clear benefit overall.


Trial_NCT00942331
Fit guideline: No
Drug: Bevacizumab, Cisplatin, Gemcitabine Hydrochloride
Result: Neutral
Explanation: This trial does not fit the guideline because it involves a clinical trial on urinary tract cancer, which includes other types of cancers beyond just prostate cancer. Additionally, Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody, is part of the intervention, which is explicitly excluded from the criteria.

Trial_NCT00988208
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Lenalidomide
Result: Negative
Explanation: Despite lenalidomide being assessed within the appropriate guideline (drug-like pharmaceutical molecule for prostate cancer), the results were not favorable. For Overall Survival (OS), the outcome was positive with median OS at 77 weeks for the lenalidomide combination group compared to NA for the control. However, for Progression-Free Survival (PFS), the median value was actually lower in the lenalidomide group (45 weeks) than the control group (46 weeks), and the Percentage of Participants with an Objective Response was also lower in the lenalidomide group (22.1%) compared to the control group (24.3%). Furthermore, the Time to Onset of Secondary Primary Malignancies was significantly shorter in the lenalidomide group (19.7 months) compared to the control group (29.7 months). Moreover, no significant benefits were observed in other assessed outcomes. Thus, the trial results suggest negative benefits when lenalidomide was added to the standard treatment of docetaxel and prednisone.

Trial_NCT00667862
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Panobinostat
Result: Negative
Explanation: The trial results indicate that panobinostat did not show therapeutic benefits in treating hormone refractory prostate cancer. Key outcome measures such as the tumor response rate and PSA response rate at 24 weeks were both 0%, indicating no significant tumor or PSA reduction. Additionally, the PSA progression rate at 24 weeks was relatively high at 48.6%. These outcomes suggest the treatment was ineffective in improving these crucial parameters, leading to the classification of the result as Negative.

Trial_NCT00668642
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Dutasteride
Result: Negative
Explanation: In both reported outcomes from the trial, the placebo group performed slightly better than the dutasteride group. Specifically, the relative expression of the U19 gene was slightly higher in the placebo group (mean value of 0.28 vs. 0.24 for the dutasteride group), which implies better gene suppression associated with the placebo. Additionally, the PSA doubling time was longer in the placebo group (mean value of 1.56 months vs. 1.42 months for the dutasteride group), indicating a slower progression of prostate cancer markers under the placebo. Given that at least one outcome was better for the control group, the result is classified as Negative.

Trial_NCT00669162
Fit guideline: No
Drug: Docetaxel, Radiation Therapy

Drug: Prostate Health Cocktail
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The clinical trial is evaluating a combination herbal therapy (Prostate Health Cocktail), which includes vitamins and supplements like vitamin D3, vitamin E, selenium, green tea extract, saw palmetto, lycopene, and soy derivatives. Since the intervention does not fit the guideline of assessing drug-like pharmaceutical molecules but rather consists of herbal and vitamin supplements, it does not fit the guideline. Furthermore, there were no specific outcomes or results provided to assess efficacy or therapeutic benefit in the trial description.

Trial_NCT00670046
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Valproic Acid
Result: Negative
Explanation: While Valproic Acid showed some positive outcomes in the increase of PSA Doubling Time and in achieving complete and partial responses, the significant drop in FACT-P scores in treatment group compared to standard of care, reflecting worsened quality of life scores, indicates a negative impact. This combined with more favorable PSA Doubling Time metrics at the end of the study in standard of care group compared to the beginning in Valproic Acid group (PSADT mean increased more prominently in the control group over time), leads to a classification of Negative result for Valproic Acid's efficacy in treating non-metastatic progressive prostate cancer.

Trial_NCT00670553
Fit guideline: No
Drug: panobinostat
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The clinical trial included treatments for conditions other than prostate cancer (esophageal cancer and head & neck cancer), so it does not fit the guideline. Additionally, the use of external beam radiotherapy as part of the intervention also disqualifies the trial according to the provided guidelines, as we are only assessing drug-like pharmaceutical molecules targeting prostate cancer. There were no outcomes or results provided, so the result is classified as Neutral.

Trial_NCT00672594
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Sunitinib Malate
Result: Negative
Explanation: The trial primarily studied Sunitinib Malate, a drug-like pharmaceutical molecule, in prostate cancer patients, hence it fits the guideline. The result is determined as Negative because while the drug was tested for safety and showed changes in apoptotic indices and other markers, the overall efficacy description and outcome measures such as increase in microvessel density (+2.75) and presence of Grade â¥4 Hematologic or Grade â¥3 Non-hematologic Toxicity suggest limited beneficial or adverse effects without clear therapeutic superiority, and some systemic parameters showed negative changes. Furthermore, there was no control group which makes the efficacy outcomes less conclusive, leaning towards a Negative classification due to observed toxicities and mixed outcome results.

Trial_NCT00673127
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Ketoconazole, Dutasteride

Moreover, there are no outcomes or results provided related to prostate cancer treatment efficacy, supporting a Neutral result.


Trial_NCT00513071
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Saracatinib
Result: Negative
Explanation: In the AZD0530 (Saracatinib) study for hormone-refractory prostate cancer, while there was no improvement in the PSA response rate which remained at 0%. Additionally, the median progression-free survival and time to treatment failure were notably low, both recorded at 1.9 months. Though overall survival was 26.0 months, the lack of efficacy indicated by other primary outcomes, specifically in progression-free metrics and absence of PSA response, leads to a classification of "Negative" for therapeutic effectiveness in this setting.

Trial_NCT00514267
Fit guideline: No
Drug: YM155, Docetaxel
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The clinical trial includes other solid tumors in addition to prostate cancer and assesses multiple conditions, therefore, it does not fit the guideline that requires exclusive focus on prostate cancer.

Trial_NCT00519285
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Aflibercept
Result: Negative
Explanation: Although Aflibercept showed a slight improvement in median overall survival and some efficacy parameters like PSA response and tumor response rate, the detailed analysis reveals mixed or neutral outcomes in other important efficacy measures such as pain progression-free survival and health-related quality of life, where either placebo performed better or there was minimal difference. Moreover, Aflibercept group had higher adverse events. Therefore, the clinical benefit of Aflibercept in this setting appears insufficient to consider it positively impactful for treating metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer.

Trial_NCT00520481
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: IMC-A12 (Cixutumumab)
Result: Negative
Explanation: Despite targeting prostate cancer with a drug-like pharmaceutical molecule, the reported outcomes such as Time to Disease Progression, Time to Radiographically Evident Disease Progression, and low PSA response rates were not favourable. No significant therapeutic benefits were demonstrated in terms of tumor response (CR or PR) or substantial PSA reductions. The median time to progression was notably short at under 5 months for the higher dose and slightly higher for the lower dose, indicating a lack of substantial benefit in delaying disease progression.

Trial_NCT00524589
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Calcitriol and Dexamethasone
Result: Negative
Explanation: Despite the focus on prostate cancer and the assessment of drug-like molecules, the trial was terminated due to futility, indicating a lack of effectiveness, with an objective response rate of 0% (no participants achieved complete or partial tumor response). Additionally, the serum calcium levels, while monitored, do not pertain directly to therapeutic effectiveness.

Trial_NCT00526591
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Everolimus
Result: Negative
Explanation: Although Everolimus fits the guideline as a drug-like pharmaceutical molecule targeting specific proteins relevant to prostate cancer, the trial results demonstrated no patients achieving pathologic complete response (P0) in either the low-dose or high-dose Everolimus cohorts. Additionally, toxicity profiles showed some adverse events, and a minimal difference in median PSA values between low and high doses without clear therapeutic benefit. The lack of clinically significant tumor reduction and my significant toxicity or beneficial PSA changes leads to a classification of Negative.

Trial_NCT00527124
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Cediranib
Result: Negative
Explanation: Despite the trial fitting the guidelines to study cediranib, a drug molecule, the results show that while there were some better responses in specific criteria for Arm I (with Cediranib), crucial indicators such as Overall Survival at 12 months were better for the control group (Arm II, 76%) compared to the treatment group (Arm I, 71%). This suggests that Cediranib did not demonstrate an overall therapeutic benefit, hence the classification as Negative.

Trial_NCT00528866
Fit guideline: No
Drug: radiation therapy, LHRH agonist
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The trial includes radiation therapy and LHRH agonists, which are not within the scope of drug-like pharmaceutical molecules defined by the guideline.

Trial_NCT00572468
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Simvastatin
Result: Negative
Explanation: The analysis results show for two critical endpoints that the placebo group had results indicating better outcomes than the Simvastatin group. The mean percentage of cells showing AR target activation was higher in the placebo group (182.73) compared to the Simvastatin group (168.67). Additionally, apoptosis measured by Ki67 staining was lower in the placebo group (6%) compared to the Simvastatin group (7.53%), suggesting fewer cancer cell deaths with Simvastatin. Therefore, the trial did not demonstrate therapeutic benefits of Simvastatin for prostate cancer compared to placebo.

Fit guideline: No
Drug: Leuprolide, Testosterone Gel, Docetaxel
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The trial involves multiple agents including a hormonal treatment (Testosterone) and a chemotherapy agent (Docetaxel), which fits the treatment guideline. However, since the therapeutic regimen also includes GnRH agonist (Leuprolide), which does not align with our specified criteria for drug-like pharmaceutical molecules as it involves hormonal therapy, this trial does not fit the guideline. Consequently, the results would be considered Neutral, irrespective of the outcomes since the trial fails to meet the initial guideline requirements.

Trial_NCT00588640
Fit guideline: No
Drug: d-Methadone
Result: Neutral
Explanation: This clinical trial is focused on chronic pain management in patients with various cancer types including prostate cancer but not exclusively. The assessment of d-Methadone's benefit is not specific to prostate cancer, and the trial primarily investigates pain management rather than anti-cancer efficacy against prostate cancer. Moreover, d-Methadone is studied in the context of safety and dosage rather than therapeutic efficacy against the disease itself. Hence, the trial does not fit the specified guideline. Consequently, evaluating its result is not applicable in this context, leading to a neutral outcome classification.

Trial_NCT00589420
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Sorafenib, Docetaxel
Result: Neutral
Explanation: Since the clinical trial involves only one treatment arm without comparative data against a control group, evaluating therapeutic efficacy conclusively is challenging. Therefore, despite observed benefits in certain outcomes like PSA response and 6-month progression-free survival, classification as "Result: Neutral" is more appropriate.

Trial_NCT00589472
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Vorinostat
Result: Negative
Explanation: The trial assessed the use of antihormone therapy and vorinostat, focusing on prostate cancer treatment. Though vorinostat is a drug-like molecule targeting specific proteins relevant to cancer treatment, the outcome results provided (e.g., pathologic complete response at the time of surgery, median Gleason score, and PSA levels) demonstrate no evidence of significant therapeutic benefits over control or baseline, thus indicating a lack of efficacy warranting a negative result.

Trial_NCT00590213
Fit guideline: No
Drug: Radiotherapy
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The intervention includes radiotherapy, which does not fit the guidelines as only drug-like pharmaceutical molecules are considered. Additionally, the trial focuses on managing side effects (gynaecomastia and breast pain) induced by Casodex therapy, rather than directly assessing therapeutic benefits against prostate cancer. Furthermore, since no outcomes or results were provided, the result is classified as Neutral.

Trial_NCT00272038
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Tarceva
Result: Negative
Explanation: Although the clinical trial assesses the activity of Erlotinib (Tarceva) which fits the guideline for drug-like molecules in prostate cancer, the outcomes indicate a poor therapeutic benefit. Despite the clinical benefit (stable disease or partial response) being at 36%, the critical outcomes such as a one-year survival rate being only 58% and the median time to disease progression very short at just 2 months suggest limited efficacy. Given that essential outcomes are not robust, the result is classified as Negative.

Trial_NCT00274287
Fit guideline: No
Drug: GM-CSF (Leukine)
Result: Neutral
Explanation: GM-CSF (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor) is considered a growth factor or cytokine rather than a drug-like pharmaceutical molecule that targets specific proteins, metabolic pathways, or other mechanisms related to prostate cancer treatment specifically. Thus, it does not fit the guideline criterion for the type of interventions our analysis is focused on. Since the trial does not fit the guideline, the result and further analysis of outcomes are irrelevant.

Trial_NCT00276549
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Gemcitabine and Docetaxel

Trial_NCT00298155
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: goserelin, dutasteride, bicalutamide, ketoconazole
Result: Negative
Explanation: The trial fits the guideline as it evaluates drug-like pharmaceutical molecules targeted at prostate cancer, specifically monitoring the effects of androgen deprivation. Group 2 showed lower serum DHT levels compared to Group 1 and Group 3, indicating a potentially more effective androgen suppression in Group 2. However, the prostate tissue DHT levels were lower in Group 1 and Group 3 compared to Group 2. The mixed outcome results, with no consistent superiority of any one treatment group across all evaluated outcomes, suggest that no individual treatment regimen demonstrated clear therapeutic benefits over the others, leading to a classification of 'Negative.'

Trial_NCT00299741
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Sunitinib
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The trial is examining the effects of Sunitinib, a drug-like pharmaceutical molecule targeting specific proteins relevant to prostate cancer treatment, on men with advanced prostate cancer, which matches the specified guideline.

Fit guideline: No
Drug: lapatinib, paclitaxel
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The trial does not fit the guideline as it involves multiple different cancer types including prostate cancer, which is mentioned among various other conditions such as bladder, brain, breast, and lung cancers. The intervention assessed includes paclitaxel, which is a platinum-based agent, and thus does not meet the specific requirements for drug-like pharmaceutical molecules strictly for prostate cancer. Furthermore, the outcome of the trial was not focused on evaluating the efficacy against prostate cancer specifically, and no results were provided. Thus, the trial's result is classified as Neutral due to the lack of specific outcomes.

Trial_NCT00313781
Fit guideline: No
Drug: CP-751,871
Result: Neutral
Explanation: CP-751,871 is described as being administered intravenously, suggesting it may be a monoclonal antibody (often denoted by the '-mab' suffix in many biologics like 'nivolumab'), which does not align with the guidelines that exclude monoclonal antibodies and require drug-like pharmaceutical molecules targeting specific proteins, metabolic pathways, or mechanisms relevant to prostate cancer treatment. Thus, the trial does not fit the guideline. Consequently, an analysis of therapeutic outcomes is unnecessary, and the designation remains Neutral due to the guideline discrepancy.

Trial_NCT00314782
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: ZD4054 (Zibotentan), Docetaxel
Result: Neutral

Trial_NCT00328614
Fit guideline: No
Drug: Samarium-153
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The intervention assessed in the trial includes Samarium-153, which is a radio-ligand and not a drug-like pharmaceutical molecule fitting our criteria. Hence, even though the trial focuses on prostate cancer treatment, it does not fit into the guidelines due to the nature of the intervention. Additionally, the trial's focus was primarily on determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for safety, rather than therapeutic efficacy against prostate cancer.

Trial_NCT00329797
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Zoledronic Acid
Result: Positive
Explanation: The trial fits the guideline because it solely focuses on prostate cancer and assesses the drug-like pharmaceutical molecule, Zoledronic Acid, summarizing its effect on preventing osteoporosis in prostate cancer patients. From the outcome results, Zoledronic Acid shows benefits in several areas, especially in Percent Change in Bone Mineral Density at 3 Years, where it outperformed control in multiple locations (significantly better mean percent changes compared to decreasing values in the control group). Additionally, despite data regarding utility and quality-adjusted survival being insufficient for judgment (missing specific values or analysis), no negative outcome sufficiently impacts the overall assessment to classify the drug negatively or neutrally. Thus, the results suggest therapeutic benefit, warranting a positive classification.

Trial_NCT00330161
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Vorinostat
Result: Negative
Explanation: The clinical trial assessed the therapeutic benefits of Vorinostat, a drug-like pharmaceutical molecule, in patients with metastatic prostate cancer, which fits the guideline. The results of the trial show progression-free survival and median overall survival at 2.8 months and 11.7 months, respectively, which indicate limited efficacy as these values suggest a relatively short duration of benefit. Additionally, there was only a 7% objective response rate indicating stable disease with no substantial improvement in the majority of patients. Consequently, these results suggest that Vorinostat did not demonstrate significant therapeutic benefits.

Trial_NCT00331344
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Ixabepilone, Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride
Result: Negative
Explanation: Despite the trial investigating the impact of Ixabepilone and Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride with prednisone on prostate cancer, the therapeutic benefits were not clearly demonstrated as effective. Specifically, the result for 'Time to Progression' was relatively short with a median of only 4.4 months indicating rapid progression despite treatment, and the safety profile showed a significant number of grade 3 or higher adverse events. The first result related to PSA declines (>50% in more than 15 of 58 patients) suggests some level of response, however, the short time to progression and high incidence of adverse events position the treatment as less beneficial overall.

Trial_NCT00334139
Fit guideline: No
Drug: Zoledronic Acid
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The trial assesses zoledronic acid, which does not fit the guideline as it involved patients with both prostate and breast cancer, violating the guideline about including conditions other than prostate cancer only.

Fit guideline: No
Drug: ECO-4601
Result: Neutral
Explanation: This clinical trial does not fit the guideline because it includes multiple types of cancers in addition to prostate cancer, which goes against the specific focus on prostate cancer alone as required. Additionally, the trial primarily aimed to assess dose tolerance, safety, and pharmacokinetics rather than therapeutic efficacy against prostate cancer specifically. No specific outcomes on therapeutic effectiveness were mentioned.

Trial_NCT00348595
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Revlimid
Result: Negative
Explanation: Although the trial specifically targeted biochemically relapsed prostate cancer, the results from various assessments indicate a lack of clear therapeutic benefit. The higher dose of Revlimid (25 mg/day) resulted in more adverse events, and both doses did not convincingly demonstrate control over PSA progression, with mixed results across the two doses. Furthermore, while there was an improvement noted in the PSA slope at the 25 mg/day dose compared to the 5 mg/day, this was not sufficient to classify the overall result as positive due to the concurrent increase in toxicity.

Trial_NCT00348816
Fit guideline: No

Trial_NCT00354432
Fit guideline: No
Drug: Soy Protein, Venlafaxine
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The trial does not fit the guideline because it primarily addresses the treatment of hot flashes in patients receiving hormone therapy for prostate cancer, rather than targeting the cancer itself. Additionally, the interventions (soy protein/isoflavones and venlafaxine) do not align with the specific drug-like pharmaceutical molecules that target proteins, metabolic pathways, or mechanisms relevant solely to the treatment of prostate cancer. As the trial assesses symptom management (hot flashes) rather than direct cancer therapy outcomes, even the assessment of trial results defaults to neutral.

Trial_NCT00365105
Fit guideline: No

The outcomes are also not focused on therapeutic benefits, but rather on imaging and safety, hence neutral is appropriate for the result.

Trial_NCT00379561
Fit guideline: No
Drug: PSA-Activated PSA-PAH1
Result: Neutral
Explanation: Although the trial specifically targets prostate cancer, the intervention involves a drug which could potentially be considered a biologically activated compound rather than a traditional drug-like pharmaceutical molecule fitting the strict criteria provided (focus is on drug-like molecules targeting specific proteins, metabolic pathways, etc.). The trial also focuses on safety and tolerability without reported clinical outcomes or therapeutic benefit results, mandating a neutral result classification.

Trial_NCT00381173
Fit guideline: No
Drug: Cyclophosphamide & ZYC300
Result: Neutral
Explanation: The trial does not fit the guideline as it assesses conditions beyond just prostate cancer, including ovarian, breast, colon, and renal cancers. Moreover, the trial outcome assessments are centered only on feasibility, safety, and tolerability, without detailed therapeutic efficacy results, indicating a neutral outcome by default.

Trial_NCT00384839
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: azacitidine
Result: Negative
Explanation: The trial assessed azacitidine in prostate cancer, meeting the guideline of drug-like pharmaceutical molecule intervention. However, the results showed a 0% PSA response rate and 0% objective response rate by RECIST, suggesting no therapeutic benefit.

Trial_NCT00417079
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: cabazitaxel
Result: Positive
Explanation: The trial compared cabazitaxel plus prednisone to mitoxantrone plus prednisone in the treatment of hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer. Cabazitaxel demonstrated significantly better outcomes in multiple areas including median overall survival, progression-free survival, overall tumor response rate, time to tumor progression, time to PSA progression, and PSA response as indicated by lower p-values and improved median or percentage values compared to the comparator, mitoxantrone. Despite similar pain response outcomes, the superiority in critical survival and progression metrics clearly supports a positive result for cabazitaxel in this setting.

Trial_NCT00417274
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Quinacrine
Result: Neutral
Explanation: This clinical trial focuses exclusively on prostate cancer and assesses the therapeutic benefits of a drug-like molecule, Quinacrine, thereby fitting the guideline. The result is classified as Neutral because the trial had only one arm, assessing only safety, tolerability, and drug levels in addition to preliminary efficacy without a comparative control group. Also, no specific outcomes or superiority data were noted in the brief, making a conclusive assessment of therapeutic benefit impossible from the information given.

Trial_NCT00459186
Fit guideline: Yes  
Drug: RAD001, Docetaxel  
Result: Negative  
Explanation: Although the trial primarily targeted prostate cancer, involving only drug-like molecules (RAD001 and Docetaxel), the results from the outcome analysis suggest lack of clear therapeutic benefit. The details about the response rate classified by PET scan show that a majority (67%) had stable metabolic disease, with only 22% showing partial metabolic response and 11% exhibiting progressive metabolic disease, indicating that the treatment did not significantly improve the metabolic response compared to baseline. The prevalence of stable disease and progression further reinforces this conclusion. Furthermore, there is no comparison with a control group, which could have helped in understanding the relative efficacy but the high rate of stable and progressive disease indicates insufficient therapeutic benefits.

Additionally, Motexafin Gadolinium is not a drug-like pharmaceutical molecule as defined in the guidelines, thereby further disqualifying this trial. Hence, we did not proceed to assess the results; Motexafin Gadolinium was the primary drug tested. As no outcomes or results were given, the result is classified as Neutral.

Trial_NCT00121238
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Cilengitide
Result: Negative
Explanation: The outcomes from the trial showed no sufficient therapeutic benefits with cilengitide for prostate cancer treatment. Outcomes included zero patients exhibiting a PSA decline of â¥50%, which is a key indicator of disease response. Additionally, the median PSA slope only showed minor changes (0.9 ng/mL/month), and the Kaplan-Meier estimates indicated short time to progression of just 1.8 months. Moreover, the Median survival time was 34.5 months, which without comparative data, does not provide evidence of significant efficacy. Combining these factors, the results suggest the drug does not significantly benefit prostate cancer patients, leading to a Negative classification.

Trial_NCT00216060
Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Risedronate
Result: Negative
Explanation: Although the trial focuses on metastatic prostate cancer and uses a drug-like molecule (Risedronate), the results across various outcomes do not conclusively demonstrate therapeutic benefits. Specifically, the primary outcome of skeletal-related events or death shows a higher number in the placebo group, but there's no significant difference (P-value: 0.3). Additionally, the urine total DPD and N-telopeptide markers improved in the Risedronate arm with significant P-values (0.001), but these are specific markers of bone turnover rather than direct indicators of prostate cancer progression or overall survival benefits, which only showed negligible differences between treatment and control groups (72.5% vs. 71.5%). Based on these results, Risedronate does not demonstrate a clear therapeutic benefit in the treatment of prostate cancer.


Trial_NCT00216099

Fit guideline: Yes
Drug: Zoledronic Acid
Result: Negative
Explanation: Although the clinical trial fits the guideline as it focuses on prostate cancer and examines a drug-like pharmaceutical molecule (Zoledronic Acid), the results from the clinical trial suggest that the Early Group (treated immediately with Zoledronic Acid) did not show a superior outcome compared to the Delayed Group (treatment delayed until PSA levels rose significantly). Specifically, while the overall survival participants and those free from skeletal-related events are numerically larger in the Early Group at 18 months and 3 years, the numbers do not indicate a statistically or clinically significant superiority, considering the comparison within the context of the trial's design itself (comparing early versus delayed treatment, both receiving the drug). Thus, the results section indicates that earlier treatment with Zoledronic Acid does not improve key outcomes compared to delayed treatment within the trial's parameters.
